    "- More than often, getting just the model's predictions is not enough when taking some problem. It's also required to understand why the models made those predictions.\n",
    "    - For example, in a credit scoring task.\n",
    "- With this goal, figuring out what features are the most important is key in interpreting our model's results.\n",
    "- With simple models like linear/logistic regression, then this information is easy to obtain: just look at the feature having the heaviest weight, and those will be the most importan features.\n",
    "- But with complex models there is no clear way to define a criteria for determining the most important features. In order to deal with this the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) were introduced. These values help to interpret each observation's prediction.\n",
